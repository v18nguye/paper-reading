- [x] **Graph Neural Network for Link Prediction with Subgraph Sketching. (ICLR23)**
    + Solved the node automorphic problem where two node are automorphic have the same representation due to equivariant permutation GNNs.
    + Used subgraph sketching to augument node features, which solved the node automorphic problem. In addition, the subgraph sketching extracted features can be
    incorporated into standard message passing for propagation.
