By given stochastic process, following a Langevin equation (Eq. 1),  which is defined by a potential function. We can apply FK equation to find the equilibrum distribution according to the potential function (Eq. 6). The Langevin equation can be written under SDE (Eq. 2), which can be further discretized with the Euler-Maruyama method (Eq. 8, 9).
